First of all, I would like to thank [Fabian](https://twitter.com/fabianfranz), [Preston](https://twitter.com/prestonso) & [Michael](https://twitter.com/michaelemeyers) for starting this series “Core Confidential”. This series will talk about the day-to-day life of a Drupal core committer. With this series, we shall also learn about [#Drupal9](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Drupal9?src=hashtag_click) readiness, Rector, and more stuff about Drupal, from Core committer’s perspective.

With this post, I want to share a few highlights which I wrote down while watching the first Inaugural episode. This post will give you a sneak-peek into what’s inside the episode.

I got to know about this via twitter:

#### Here are some things you can expect in this video.

> … So all the exciting stuff basically has already happened in Drupal 9…

**Preston asks the main question by 11:30 minutes** 😅. But I won’t recommend skipping to that time, because there are lots of things discussed right from the 0th minute of the video.   
_Spoiler ⚠️ : This will be answered at last._

**Fabian answers the Big WHY of Drupal core issues**. Why it takes so much time to get something in core and it's quite thoughtful and beautiful to understand how much review is done before a patch is allowed to get in.

**Drupal 7 still conservative than Drupal 8.** How it is easier to make change in Drupal 8 etc.

### Fabian prefers Tea over coffee… :)

**Iterative approaches for introducing new features into Drupal.**

**Why code is deprecated in Drupal 8?**

**Drupal 10?**

### Watch the video here:

There are many things I haven’t mentioned here, I would recommend watching the full episode for complete insights.

### Conclusion

I have to admit that the conversation was crisp, to the point, high quality and most importantly informative. So special thanks to Preston & Michael for beautifully crafting this entire episode and Fabian for answering.

Thank you, Fabian, you were expressive. 😁

Looking forward to more episodes on #CoreConfidential.

Thanks for Reading.
