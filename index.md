Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a web enthusiast primarily focused on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org){:target="_blank"}. I am also an active contributor to Open Source (mostly Drupal). I am also interested in JS related technologies.

Apart from writing code, I also enjoy mentoring. Help folks learn Web fundamentals, Drupal, etc. Also, I like to onboard people to the world of Open Source.

My main goal in creating this personal space is to share my findings & experiences. Learn new stuff like static website generator and most importantly to get into a regular habit of writing blogs. I have written a few posts in the past which you can find in the blogs section(coming soon).
