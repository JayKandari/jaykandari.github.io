Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a web enthusiast primarily focused on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/u/jaykandari){:target="_blank"}. I am also an active contributor to Open Source (mostly Drupal). I am also interested in JS related technologies.

Apart from writing code, I also enjoy mentoring. Help folks learn Web fundamentals, Drupal, etc. Also, I like to onboard people to the world of Open Source.

My main goal in creating this personal space is to share my findings & experiences. Learn new stuff like static website generator and most importantly to get into a regular habit of writing blogs. I have written a few posts in the past which you can find in the blogs section.

In case if you notice anything weird on this space will highly appreciate it if you reach out.

Thanks for reading!
